# Project Overview

# Web3-Tribes

`Web3-Tribes` is a project utilizing the tribes module from Decentology's [hyperverse](https://www.decentology.com/hyperverse). The aim 
of this project is to allow users to join different web3 tribes (communities) and gain access to content only visible to those in that specific tribe.

## Project Building Tools

### [Decentology](https://www.decentology.com/)
This project is built on [Decentology's Smart Modules](https://www.decentology.com/hyperverse) known as Hyperverse which is an open marketplace of community-built,
audited and easy to discover smart modules.
It is an open and decentralized marketplace for composable smart contracts.

If you wanted to read more about hyperverse. I highly recommend reading their amazing [blog](https://www.decentology.com/blog/composing-the-hyperverse).
- And for any questions please join the [Decentology Discord](http://discord.gg/decentology).

### [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)

Filecoin IPFS is a permanent and a decentralized storage network designed to store data.

Our project also uses IPFS for storing the data once a post is created in a particular tribe. Which means the post is permanent and can't be deleted.
We have used [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage/) Javascript client library for the storage of our data.

- If you want to learn more on how the IPFS works, Consider reading this [blog](https://ipfs.io/#how).

### Solidity Smart Contract

We built our own smart contract for storing our metadata URL's from IPFS, Since we want our project to be completely decentralized.
- Our smart contract is deployed on the rinkeby network.


# Here's how users can use our [Website](https://web3con-lw-3-tribe.vercel.app/)

### Prerequisities

To be able to interact with the dapp, you need a Metmask Wallet and Rinkeby eth.

1. **Metamask**

    If you do not have a metamask wallet, [here](https://www.surgewomen.io/learn-about-web3/set-up-metamask-wallet) is a guide you can follow on how to set up one.

2. **Rinkeby Faucets**

    To get some Rinkeby eth here are some available faucets you can request from:

-   https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/
-   https://app.mycrypto.com/faucet


After clicking on the [link](https://web3con-lw-3-tribe.vercel.app/) You will enter this page.

- Now that you have your metamask wallet set up with some rinkeby eth. You should connect your wallet by clicking on the Connect Wallet button on the top right corner.

- After connecting your wallet you will be able to join any tribe out of the three options available.

Now comes the fun part where you can actually post whatever you want.

- First you can set up the title of the post so that the people interested can read the description and read the post you made.


- Remember it is mandatory to fill in all the three sections otherwise you would not be able to submit your post.

- Here's an example for better understanding.

- Also as soon as you join a tribe you will be able to see everyone's posts and learn about what they've been upto.
